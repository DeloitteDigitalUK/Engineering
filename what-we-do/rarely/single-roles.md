# Staffing "ones and twos"

We believe that a strong teams is greater than the sum of its parts. Our career model is based on our people developing and learning from each other. The way we manage quality is similarly founded on teams taking collective ownership of an outcome. Even our commercial model hinges on staffing teams with a mixture of specialisms and experience.

That is why it is often difficult for us to staff "ones and twos" on projects without a wider team around them. If we put, say, a technical lead on her own in an architect role, then we end up with "orphan" teams of junior developers with no-one to lead them, and that technical lead might not get the same opportunity to demonstrate and hone her leadership skills. Similarly, when a client asks for one or two developers to augment their own teams, we will worry about whether those developers have the same opportunity to learn and grow as they would if based in a team with other colleagues.

When a client needs a single technical role filled, and there is limited near term opportunity to grow the team and take ownership over an outcome, we can often best help by using our network of associates to find someone with the right skills and experience in the external market. If we have relevant skills in our team, we can also help create a role description and interview candidates.
