# Engineering advisory

We are engineers at heart. We love the creativity and artistry of building software. Between us we have built some great things, and we have learned a lot along the way. We love sharing our stories and insights.

However, we rarely do pure advisory work. We work by side with our clients and learn from them as much as they do from us. For the more traditional consulting engagements of mapping an as-is process, designing a to-be and figuring out the steps in-between, we will defer to our very talented colleagues in the wider Deloitte Technology Consulting practice, offering our help as subject matter experts when applicable.
