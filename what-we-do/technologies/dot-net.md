# .NET

Microsoft’s web, mobile and desktop application stack.

We have deep expertise in Microsoft’s .Net stack for web, mobile (Xamarin) and desktop apps. Of the .Net family of languages, C# is our preferred one, and we use it not just when building bespoke web and mobile apps, but also when customising and integrating with products such as BizTalk and Sitecore.
