# Front end web

Bringing the richest desktop and mobile experiences to users directly in their browsers

A few years ago, a front-end developer knew their site would be viewed on a desktop and their logic would be handled off in a server somewhere. Provided IE didn't mess around too much, life was easy.

Not so anymore. Our front-end developer works with mobiles, tablets, desktops, and a multitude of sizes in between. They handle an ever-growing set of standards in HTML5, CSS3+, and the now yearly ECMAScript proposals for JavaScript, building apps to rival any native experience, and bringing the richest desktop and mobile experiences to users directly in their browsers.

React, Angular, Meteor, Vue. And it's not just our frameworks that have changed, everything has. Webpack and Gulp are killer build tools. Redux, RxJS, MobX are whole new things to think about data. Even testing has gotten exciting with Jest, Karma, Mocha and the numerous utility libraries for each.
