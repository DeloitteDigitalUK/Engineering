# Java and the JVM

Creating robust and scalable applications in an ever-changing landscape of libraries and frameworks.

Java is often our weapon of choice for the heavy lifting in the back end. Whether rendering web pages, exposing an API, integrating with core business services, or customising a product, our Java engineers navigate a complex landscape of libraries and frameworks, apply solid (and SOLID) design principles and continuously test and integrate their code to create robust and scalable applications.

In addition to Java, we sometimes use other JVM languages such as Scala and Kotlin when the situation calls for it.
