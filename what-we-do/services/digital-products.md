# Digital product development

We support ideation through prototyping and experimentation, and take ownership of end to end technical delivery and evolution of new digital products.

When our clients are faced with digital disruption, or want to be disruptors of their industry, they turn to Deloitte Digital to work with them to imagine and shape new digital propositions and products. In Deloitte Digital Engineering, we support ideation through prototyping and experimentation. We then take ownership of the end to end technical delivery and evolution of these new products.

We work across industries and technologies to deliver the right solution for each client. Some of the things we have built recently include:

- Slick online and mobile new customer journeys for banks who needed to attract a new generation of customers.
- Award-winning tools to help customers of insurance products understand their readiness for retirement.
- Tablet and mobile banking solutions that help customers understand and manage their finances through personally tailored insights.
- Apps that enable travelling salespeople to better service their customers face to face.
- Citizen-facing digital government services used by millions of people each year.
