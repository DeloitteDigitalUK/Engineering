# Digital solution integration

Not just a veneer: digital solutions at the heart of business.

Digital solutions are like icebergs. Above the waterline, an app or a website. The question is not how long it takes to build initially, but how rapidly it can be iterated as we understand the true customer needs and behaviours.

But the real challenge often lies below the surface. How will we create a seamless, omni-channel product? What core business systems do we need to integrate with, or change, to enable the best possible end user experience?

We work with our clients' existing technical teams to rapidly and safely integrate the digital products we create into their businesses. And of course we use the same practices and techniques we would anywhere to manage quality and pace.
