# On site

We are in the business of solving complex business problems with innovative technology solutions. To do that, we need to understand our clients' business. And the best way to do that is to spend time with them; to become one team; to build a product together.

In almost all of our projects, we have a sizeable team on site with the client - or bring the client into our studio. We are in the business of solving complex business problems with innovative technology solutions. To do that, we need to understand our clients' business. And the best way to do that is to spend time with them; to become one team; to build a product together.

When we work on site with a client, they invite us into their home. We are honoured to be their guests. We are looking for osmosis: our clients rub off on us a little, and a little bit of our culture rubs off on them. We will typically bring our own tools and ways of working, and adapt them to the client's context.

It is important to be mindful right from the beginning about how the product we develop will be owned and supported by the client long term. The right architectural and tooling choices strike a balance between what we know, what our clients have, and where the wider world is heading.

Working on site sometimes means travel. Some of our clients are near our studios, others are not. A typical "away" project might involve travelling to a client's offices (almost always in the UK) on Monday morning, and returning on a Thursday night. We do believe that it is important that our people spend time together outside of immediate client work, to share ideas, to be able to lean on each other, to innovate, and to strengthen our teams.
