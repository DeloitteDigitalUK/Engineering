# Off-shore

Deloitte has a large global solution delivery network, including a big development centre in India. For Deloitte Digital Engineering projects, it is less common that we deliver all or the most critical elements of a solution using fully off shore teams, but for certain types of work and access to certain skills and scale, off shore is absolutely the right solution.

The principles that apply to near shore teams apply to offshore teams as well. We believe it is important to have a human connection between everyone in the team - be they our staff or clients. With off shore we have to be even more deliberate about how we shape the work and how we communicate.
