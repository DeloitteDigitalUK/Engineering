# Quality assurance

At the heart of our approach to quality assurance is the notion that quality isn't something that can be "tested in" at the end; it has to be built in from the start.

We look at quality through two lenses:

- *External quality* -- are we building the right thing?
- *Internal quality* -- are we building it right?

In addition to practices such as test automation and Behaviour Driven Development, our teams will typically engage in three ceremonies designed to help build quality in from the beginning:

- *Product owner sign-off* is the act of asking the client's business representative to review our articulation of their requirements and confirm that it matches their requirements.
- *BA QA* involves the business analysts sitting down with the developers to review a near-finished implementation of a requirement to assure *external* quality.
- *Tech QA* involves the technical lead or a senior developer pairing with the developers to review a branch of code that is proposed to be merged to assure *internal* quality.
