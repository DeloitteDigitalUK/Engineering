# Test automation

Test automation is a core pillar of our approach to quality. Our developers are expected to write automated unit and integration tests for all their code.

Writing for testability means writing cleaner, more robust, more maintainable, higher quality code. Automating testing means faster feedback, greater confidence to refactor and improve the solution, and less human error in the quality process. That is not to say that manual testing isn't also important, but human testing should focus on the unexpected, on the end user experience, and on things that are impossible to automate, not on laborious fact-checking.

We do not chase statement test coverage (a metric of how much of the solution's code is covered by automated tests) for the sake of it, but we do use metrics such as test coverage and static code analysis to inform decisions about where best to invest our time in our drive for continuous quality improvement.

We approach automation with professional pragmatism, over-testing the critical and the complicated, optimising for "fail-fast" and useful feedback, and writing tests that are resilient to desirable refactoring.
