# Behaviour Driven Development

Where test automation is a practice to help us "build it right", Behaviour Driven Development is a favoured technique to help us "build the right thing".

BDD starts with a conversation: our business analysts and developers talk with users and with our clients, using examples and, where appropriate, structured language to capture not just the sentiment of a requirement, but the boundaries and constraints that help us understand the underlying intent and know when we have succeeded. We do this just-in-time, days or hours before development is due to commence on a requirement.

We will typically capture these conversations in some detail, expressed as examples, and play them back to our clients' business representatives for approval. This helps validate our understanding and minimises the chance of unnecessary rework. It also gives our developers as clear and unambiguous a statement of the detailed requirement as possible.

In many cases, we will also write automated tests against these requirements. Whilst not a substitute for our client's hands-on feedback, these tests can help guard against functional regressions during continuous integration.
