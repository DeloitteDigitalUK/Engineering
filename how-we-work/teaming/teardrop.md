# The teardrop

How big is the ideal team? And who should be in it? We believe we have a good answer, and we call it the teardrop.

Most of our software development engagements comprise one or more cross-functional "feature teams" with:

* One senior developer
* Two to four developers
* One or two junior developers

As opposed to a pyramid, this "teardrop" shape directly encourages mentorship and review of junior developers by senior developers, whilst having enough developer firepower to tackle the building of complex real-world requirements.

The exact skills in each team will vary from project to project, but we aim to allow each feature team to take full ownership of an end-to-end aspect of the solution (or the whole solution, on smaller engagements).

In addition to the feature team(s), our engagements typically feature a more senior Technical Lead, a Functional Lead and a team of business analysts (often embedded in the feature teams), a Test Lead and testers (ditto), and senior engagement management.
