# Kanban

Kanban is a framework for modelling and optimising a process. Using a combination of visual management, explicit limiting of work in progress, and an evolutionary approach to delivery optimisation, Kanban helps us adapt and evolve throughout the course of an engagement.

The Kanban Method, as described by David J. Anderson, and the wider body of Lean Product Development, as described by Don Reinertsen, have been big influences on our approach to software delivery. We take a systemic view, modelling and optimising the flow of work across teams and specialisms to not only deliver with efficiency, but also to provide the tools to help our clients build the right thing, get to market quickly, and minimise the cost of delay.
