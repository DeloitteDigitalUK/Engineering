# How we work

How we work is a reflection of who we are and what we believe in.

We work [in teams](./teaming/staffing-teams.md), shaped like a [tear-drop](./teaming/teardrop.md).

We work [on-site with our clients](./working-with-clients/on-site.md), as well as through our high calibre [near-shore](./working-with-clients/near-shore.md) and [off-shore](./working-with-clients/off-shore.md) delivery centres.

We believe in [Agile](./methods/agile.md), [Kanban](./methods/kanban.md), and [DevOps](./methods/devops.md).

We employ leading practices like [continuous integration](./practices/ci.md), [continuous delivery](./practices/cd.md), [test-driven development](./practices/tdd.md), [behaviour-driven development](./practices/bdd.md), and [robust quality assurance](./practices/qa.md).

We engage with clients on a [fixed price](./engagement-models/fixed-price.md), [time and materials](./engagement-models/time-and-materials.md), or [shared value](./engagement-models/shared-value.md) basis, depending on what is most appropriate.
