# How we work

How we work is a reflection of who we are and what we believe in.

We work [in teams](./teaming/staffing-teams), shaped like a [tear-drop](./teaming/teardrop).

We work [on-site with our clients](./working-with-clients/on-site), as well as through our high calibre [near-shore](./working-with-clients/near-shore) and [off-shore](./working-with-clients/off-shore) delivery centres.

We believe in [Agile](./methods/agile), [Kanban](./methods/kanban), and [DevOps](./methods/devops).

We employ leading practices like [continuous integration](./Practices/ci), [continuous delivery](./Practices/cd), [test-driven development](./Practices/tdd), [behaviour-driven development](./Practices/bdd), and [robust quality assurance](./Practices/qa).

We engage with clients on a [fixed price](./engagement-models/fixed-price), [time and materials](./engagement-models/time-and-materials), or [shared value](./engagement-models/shared-value) basis, depending on what is most appropriate.
