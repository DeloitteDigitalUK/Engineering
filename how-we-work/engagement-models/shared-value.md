# Shared value

Sometimes we will work on a project where we can base our commecical engagement on some kind of shared value with our client; where we will have even more skin in the game.

This might be managed in a number of ways, such as:

* a proportion of our fees are contingent on a specific, measurable outcome
* we will gain a slice of the future revenue of the product we are developing
* we will share in the ownership of the IP we develop for clients

In all cases, we will assess the potential for this type of arrangement carefully and design an approach where our incentives align closely with the incentives of our client's senior management team.
