# Time & materials

For complex engagements where we are working hand-in-hand with our clients to explore and develop a proposition, we will sometimes work on a time-and-materials basis.

This often takes the form of "fixed price for fixed capacity" or "capped time-and-materials" to allow our clients budget predictability. This allows a shift towards a budget mentality, where the key question becomes:

> What is the most value we can deliver with the time and capacity we have?

The other scenario in which we might work on a time-and-materials basis is when we do not have direct accountability for the outcome of the engagement, for example where the client is leading the work and we are playing a smaller part. Whilst we typically prefer not to work in this way, it may be appropriate sometimes, e.g. when we have a long-standing relationship with a client and are delivering a portfolio of work for them.
