# Environment

Our studios are our home: the true reflection of who we (and the rest of Deloitte Digital) are. They are filled with interesting technology, whiteboards, sticky notes and screens. Our delivery teams sit together, around tables and surrounded by the tools they need to do their work.

We work primarily on Macs, and most developers opt for a high-spec MacBook Pro. Our machines contain some necessary security software, but we have root access and we can get whatever software and hardware we need to work effectively (including Windows laptops if required). You don't need to ask permission to install something and you can use your Mac for personal stuff, though we expect you to be reasonable, sensibly secure and not break any laws.

In the office, we tend to be business casual -- emphasis on *casual*. Think jeans and a shirt, or maybe a t-shirt if appropriate.

Our clients sometimes come to us, but we often go to them, working from their offices. When we do, we are respectful of their environment and adapt accordingly, but at the same time our clients often want us to bring some of our culture and ways of working to them, so we don't bend too far.
