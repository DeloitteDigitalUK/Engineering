# Community

Engineering is a family within a broader family (Deloitte Digital) within an extend family (Deloitte at large). Most of us know each other, and everyone -- junior or senior -- is approachable face-to-face in the office, via email, or on a collaboration tool like Slack. Most of us have work friends who are also outside-of-work friends; the sort of people you invite to your wedding or around for dinner.

The third Friday of each month, we hold a town hall for Engineering in the morning (and one for all of Deloitte Digital in the afternoon), where we talk about big achievements and changes, introduce new joiners and run retrospectives to help us figure out how to continually improve. We also engage in our fair share of "mandatory fun", both formally and informally.

Of course, our day-to-day interactions will typically be with our project teams. Most of our projects are both reasonably large and reasonably long in duration, so there is plenty of time to get to know your colleagues better. More often than not, project teams will organise socials and events around major milestones.
