# Career Paths

Like all professional services firms, Deloitte has a structured career model. Each of us operate at a given grade at any one point in time, and that grade influences things like pay, responsibilities and expectations.

The basic principle is that you are promoted when you are ready. (Promotion readiness is assessed on an annual basis, but you will be given feedback much more frequently.) "Ready" in this case refers to a published set of behaviours and skills that we expect at each grade. When you demonstrate that you are already operating at the next level, you will be rewarded with promotion.

You need to take responsibility for your own career. It is important to have a direction and a sense of the "the thing you do". However, it's perfectly fine (and quite common) for that *thing* to evolve over time as you are exposed to more projects and experiences. We don't want to pigeon-hole and we actively encourage our people to broaden their experiences and learn different things, be that more programming languages, how to be an effective salesperson, or what it means to be a leader... or any number of other things. You get plenty of formal and informal support to figure all that out.

There are few cross cutting expectations that apply to all grades:

- **Put the client’s long-term needs first**: Satisfying our client’s needs, building solutions that are effective and efficient in their specific context, is the reason we are here. We listen, we are flexible, and we are pragmatic. Sometimes that means challenging the client’s assumptions and approaches. We do this _with_ the client, not _to_ them.
- **Act as part of a team**: We believe that the unit of delivery is the team, not the individual. Our value proposition is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Everyone has a part to play in making sure the team works on both a professional and an interpersonal level.
- **Respect others**: We believe that diversity makes us stronger. Working well with those who are different from you, whether by gender, race, sexual orientation, physical ability, caring responsibilities, or something else, is a core skill, and one that deserves personal investment like any other.
- **Be a professional**: You are the firm’s brand. Being a professional does not mean putting on a suit (but try to avoid sandals). It means acting with integrity, respect, and commitment at all times. We don’t cut corners just because we could get away with it. We own up to our mistakes. We deliver bad news with the same urgency and care that we deliver good news.
- **Stay curious**: We don’t expect you to know everything, but we do expect you to want to keep learning, growing, and challenging your own assumptions, whether you are a graduate or a Partner.
- **Be agile at heart**: Agile is something that you are, not something that you do. We want you to understand and embrace the principles and values of agile in your day-to-day work.
- **Take responsibility for the process**: We strive to achieve _flow_ in our work. Working effectively means participating proactively in the delivery process, and finding ways to improve it over time.
- **Take responsibility for quality**: While there are sometimes specialised testing roles, the team as a unit is responsible of the solution quality. The job is not done until the solution is proven to work, and quality isn’t something we add at the end. Test-driven development is part of our DNA.
- **Take responsibility for operability**: While there are specific infrastructure engineering skills, all engineers are responsible of creating solutions that are operable, and operating solutions that can continuously improved.

##  Engineering grades

Specific definitions of what it means to operate at each grade are outlined below.

### Analyst Developer

At this level, your main focus is on learning your craft. This is where our graduates start out, but we also hire directly into this grade. 

You are expected to be hungry to learn something new every day, to keep an open mind, to ask for help constructively, and to contribute where you can. You are part of a formal traineeship programme that aims to teach you how to be an effective consultant and a good developer. This typically lasts two years.

If you have joined via the graduate intake you will need to complete the requirements of the ‘Analyst Induction Programme’ (AIP) as well as meeting the standards of a Developer. If you were hired directly into the Analyst Developer grade, you will not complete all the formalities of the AIP, but you should review the training available on the AIP with your coach to decide which would be helpful for you given your background. The requirements of the AIP also highlight some of the breadth required from a career in consulting which may not have been the case in your previous experience.

### Developer

Now you are no longer a trainee, but that doesn’t mean you’ve stopped learning. You have useful, core skills in one or more technologies that you can apply in a project context, and you are starting to move beyond the precise practices you were taught, gaining a better understanding of the underlying principles that make them work. You will take responsibility for your own productivity, and begin to take ownership over components within an overall solution. It’s also likely that you’ll also start to manage and mentor some more junior people on your project.

General expectations:

- Working independently within your core technical skillset.
- Applying relevant good practice design and coding standards to your own work.
- Formulating designs for components and small solutions, working with more senior developers to obtain ideas and feedback.
- Being self-driven in terms of quality and process.
- Identifying and escalating risks appropriately.
- Actively and constructively participating in delivery processes and ceremonies such as planning sessions, retrospectives, and reviews.
- Supporting and mentoring more junior developers.
- Actively seeking to learn new skills, technologies.
- Engaging with and contributing to the wider practice outside of the immediate project.

Technical expectations:

- Producing clean code.
- Awareness of relevant design patterns.
- Deep understanding of object-orientated programming, data structures, and algorithms.
- Writing effective automated unit and integration tests.
- Understanding RESTful web services.
- Understanding core agile practices such as Scrum and Kanban.
- Being familiar with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.
- Comfortably using version control system such as git.

### Senior Developer

You are now responsible not just for the impact you make with your own work, but also for your wider impact on others, for example by leading small teams, inspiring people, taking greater responsibility for the quality and architecture of the solution, and/or building productive client relationships. You’ll also start to play a bigger role in the practice and our internal community.

General expectations:

- Being an expert in your core skillset.
- Coaching others in the application of good practice and coding standards.
- Having a passion for quality and attention for detail.
- Taking an active interest in design and user experience, working with specialist colleagues to design solutions that are beautiful on the inside as well as the outside.
- Proactively managing risk with your team and project.
- Managing small teams or taking ownership over technical outcomes.
- Ability to act as the guardian of a team's process and lead key ceremonies such as stand-ups, retrospectives, and planning sessions.
- A good awareness of the project context and the client’s main objectives.
- Supporting tenders and pitches as a credible technical expert in your domain.

Technical expectations:

- Developing elegant, efficient and scalable software designs and architecture.
- Producing clean and effective code.
- Reviewing and debugging code.
- Deep understanding of design patterns.
- Deep understanding of web services and networking.
- General knowledge of security and cyber risks.

### Technical Lead

You are now considered an expert at what you do. You might be the most senior technologist on your project, and your clients will start to see you as the face of our technical delivery. You’ll be responsible for the work of several teams, either in a managerial capacity, in a coaching and quality assurance role, or as a solution architect. The solution we are building has your name on it, so you’re going to care passionately about its quality.

You’ll be inspirational to our people and our clients, and you might play a big part in our practice, for example by leading a technical community or taking ownership over things like recruitment or learning. You’ll also start to build a team around you, some of whom you will take with you as you move between projects. These people will start to see you as vital to their own career growth.

General expectations:

- Internally famous for your expertise in your core skillset, moving beyond prescribed practices to achieve true mastery.
- Proving our technical credibility to clients in sales and project shaping situations.
- Supporting tenders with technical expertise, architecture, and estimation.
- Acting as a coach and role model for others in your sphere of interest.
- Acting as a peer and trusted colleague to leaders from adjacent professions, such as design, user experience, and project management, as part of a leadership _team_.
- Having an impact on a larger number of people, either through direct management, or by setting standards and building the runway to enable them to work productively and safely.
- Setting and assuring good practices and standards.
- Inspiring a passion for quality and a desire to build the best possible product in your teams.
- Strong communication skills, with the ability to communicate clearly about both technical and business matters.
- Staying up to date on industry trends and bringing new ideas to the client and the team.
- Taking ownership of risks and their mitigation.

At this point in your career, you may start to specialise more as either a delivery lead, a principal developer, or an architect. Your own focus may include a mixture of these skills, but at a high level, the expectations of each type of technical lead are:

#### Principal Developer

- Ability to write clear, high-performance code that solves complex problems.
- Designing and building frameworks, tools, and platforms that make us more productive and effective.
- Demonstrated experience designing, building and maintaining large-scale, high-performance systems.

#### Architect

- With a development background, understanding architecture and its value.
- Designing evolutionary architecture.
- Writing code alongside the development team, helping to make your architecture real.
- Advising our clients on architecture related concerns.

#### Technical Delivery Lead

- Building, supporting, and mentoring high performing delivery teams.
- Acting as a champion for our delivery methods, and evolving good delivery practice.
- Working with your team to solve problems and remove impediments.
- Writing code alongside your development team, helping them succeed.
- Representing (and sometimes, protecting) your team to clients and senior stakeholders.
- Facilitating your team through estimating and planning, creating a shared vision of what is possible and reasonable.

### Senior Technical Lead

You are now a junior member of our leadership team. You’ll be involved in bigger projects and responsible for more complex solutions – solutions that your clients might consider business-critical. You are also recognised outside the firm for your skills and expertise. You are an inspiring leader and you have built a team around you, who are rooting for you to succeed.

Senior Technical Lead is the first grade for which you need to present a business case and participate in an evaluation process that includes a panel interview. The business case is an opportunity for you to articulate what you do, and how it is additive to the firm and our clients. You should expect to invest significant time and effort into developing and articulating your business case, working with a range of mentors and senior supporters along the way.

#### Chief Engineer

Some, but far from all, of our Senior Technical Leads will be recognised as a Chief Engineer, a particular role that describes some of our most experienced and capable technologists. Our Chief Engineers are our guardians of quality and innovation:

- On a project, the role of a Chief Engineer is to make us the best engineers we can be on that project.

- In the practice, the role of a Chief Engineer is the make us the best engineers we can be, full stop.

Our Chief Engineers do this by:

- acting as architects and technical leaders on large engagements;
- providing technical assurance over one large and/or multiple smaller engagements;
- offering a pragmatic, constructive counterbalance to short term date- or budget-driven decisions in the interest of doing what is right for the long term health of the solution and the delivery team;
- inspiring our people to take pride in their craft and adopt good working practices;
- helping project teams share their experiences and innovations with the wider practice; and 
- chairing Solution Review Boards for projects.

### Technical Director

This is a senior leadership role in our business. What you do will be very personal to you and your career. You will have presented a specific business case for your promotion, which you are now executing on.

### Partner

Our Partners are the owners and stewards of our business. Each project, client account and business unit will have a Partner who is ultimately personally accountable for its success. Being a Partner in Deloitte is an entrepreneurial endeavour, focused on creating new opportunities and capabilities that drive us forward as a business and make this a meaningful and exciting place for our people to build their careers.

## Promotion Timelines

People typically spend between 2 and 5 years at each stage, although there is more variation at the more senior grades. We believe that it is important that you are ready across all aspects of expectation before you are promoted. It is better to have momentum in your career than to scrape into the next grade and then fail to meet some expectations.

Promotions take place annually, following a series of talent reviews and diligence on each individual. Senior Technical Lead, Technical Director, and Partner promotions have specific processes, entered by invitation, that run over a number of months.

In general, there is more divergence in what people do as they progress in grade. Whilst most of our junior developers will spend most of their day writing code, our more senior staff will find a balance of work that suits their interests and skills, branching out into things like technical leadership, building of frameworks and tools, architecture, team management, sales and the nurturing of long term client relationships, management of our own business, and more. In fact, the more senior you become, the more the focus will be on doing something new and entrepreneurial – something that no-one else does, and that is genuinely additive to our business.

## How and when to specialise

Front end or back end? Web or mobile? Java or Python? The range of technologies we use is now so broad that we all have to make choices about what we learn and practice. For some, that choice is easy. Others are worried about closing off avenues too soon.

In general, we find that the best engineers are those who have a breadth of expertise. Being proficient in more than one programming language, stack, and/or domain will make you a better engineer full stop. Only by broadening your perspectives do you being to appreciate the underlying principles that lead to high quality code and elegant solutions. However, being merely skin deep in dozens of technologies will limit how useful you can be in any one of them.

In the early years of your career, it is in your interest to get exposure to a range of roles, domains, and technologies. This will help you gain an appreciation of the challenges and opportunities each presents, and give you a chance to understand what type of work you find most interesting. Most people will specialise more as they get more senior, but there is no hard and fast rule.

As general guidance:

- Try to learn at least one scripting language (e.g. Bash), one interpreted language (e.g. Python, JavaScript, Ruby), and one general-purpose statically typed language (e.g. Java, C#).
- Gain experience across both the front end (web, mobile) and back end (server-side, integration) domains.
- Spend some time in ops, managing infrastructure and pipeline code.
- Try to learn one new technology, pattern, library, or tool every few months, both because they may be useful to you, and to keep your aptitude for learning sharp.

As you try more things, you will find some more enjoyable than others. Your enjoyment is a reasonable proxy for what you are good at, and what you are good at is a reasonable proxy for what the firm values you for. In other words: do what you love, once you figure out what that is.

## Industry and capability

In the firm more widely, it is typical to become more specialised to an industry or sector as you become more senior. That is often true of engineers as well, but we often find that engineers prefer to remain fungible across industries for longer.

Industry alignment has advantages. Account teams run along the industry dimension, and they are the ones who help you win the work you want to do. Some industries also have particularly relevant technology vendors, patterns, and constraints that you will be expected to be familiar with.

However, fungibility has its advantages. The biggest, most interesting projects may not always come from the same industry. Cross-pollination of experience is also valuable to our clients, who often find experience from other industries a selling point.

Ultimately, whether and when to align to a particular industry is a personal choice, albeit one that is sometimes made with retrospective coherence. You should work with your coach and other relevant leaders to understand what is right for you.

## Long and short projects

A career in consulting often carries the expectation of variety. An eclectic mix of short projects can be good, especially if you are not yet sure where your interests lie and want to try a few different technologies and industries.

However, you shouldn’t underestimate the value of being on a large and long-term project. Long term roles allow you to make a bigger impact and build deeper relationships. Especially at the more junior grades, larger and longer term projects can offer more opportunities for “stretch” roles, because there will be more support and coaching available, and because you will have had more opportunity to prove you are ready.
 
As part of this, think about how you can have a positive impact on the practice through your project, even if you are going to be there a while. If you are building a great team, mentoring others, introducing new processes and tools, and building lasting relationships with your colleagues and clients, then you are making an impact that will last beyond the project – probably more so than if you are on the bench and write a thought piece or attend a recruitment event. Making a success of the project and sharing that success outside the project is not just good for your career, it’s the main way in which we grow and improve the wider business.
