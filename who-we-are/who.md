# Who and why

What kind of people succeed in Deloitte Digital Engineering? Who finds working here fulfilling and rewarding? What do you get from a career at Deloitte?

Clearly, there is no single answer to any of those questions, but we can consider some of the more commonly cited reasons for people to join and make their career here.

## Access to complex business problems

Deloitte has relationships at the very top level of the largest, most ambitious organisations in the world. When they have deep and complex business problems, they call us. And often the answers to those problems involve a great deal of product engineering.

> "How can we attract a new generation of customers? Perhaps through digital channels?"
> 
> "We are being undercut by new, digitally native competitors. How can we leapfrog them?"
> 
> "We want to modernise our business, top to bottom. Can you help us?"

If having the chance to work on these types of problems excites you, then Deloitte is a great place for you to be. When we deliver a programme for a client, it is often *the* most important thing that particular client is doing at that time. We get the attention of the CIOs and CEOs of businesses and organisations that you and your friends know and admire. We shape companies and industries.

And you get to say, "I was part of making that."

## Big, messy, and real-world

Working on these types of problems for these types of clients is not like working for a start-up, or on a non-critical project for a larger business. It's big. It's messy. There is legacy, and culture, and an existing workforce. Customers, regulators, and politics. It's hard work sometimes.

For some, this is frustrating. We may want to use the latest and greatest technologies (and we typically do), but we also have to consider how it will integrate with the client’s existing technology landscape. We need to bring the client on the journey, even if they are starting from a different place, so that the transformation is something we do *with* them and not *to* them. That can take time, and patience, and compromise. Pragmatism is an important word in our vocabulary.

But this can also be hugely rewarding. Those who think of navigating the messy real-world as a first-order problem rather than an irritant will find a career at Deloitte fascinating. We find ways to help our clients go beyond what they imagined to be possible.

## Working with the client

We believe that the best way to help our clients is to immerse ourselves in their environment. Projects vary, but we typically have some or all of our team on-site with the client in their offices.

That means that whilst your Deloitte office is your professional homestead, you may not spend the majority of your time there. There are different models, especially in our delivery centres, but travel is a part of the job for a great many of our people, and when we work on site with the client, we need to adapt to their culture and work environment, at least up to a point.

If your client is a stone's throw from your house, then that may have its advantages. If getting to work involves taking a flight, then you will be staying in hotels, on what we call an "away project". Away projects can be a lot of fun, and there is a strong sense of community among the people who travel to a particular client, but it can also be straining, especially with personal commitments outside of work.

We will always be reasonable, and work with you to make sure you have a pattern that works for you as well as for the firm. However, if the idea of working away from home puts you off, you need to carefully consider and understand to what extent your role is likely to involve travel.

## Services, not products

It is important to remember that Deloitte (for the most part) is a professional services company. We serve our clients through projects that bring our expertise and capability to them. We build new products, but they belong to our clients.

For some, that is a blessing: a chance for variety, and to subtly re-invent yourself each time you start a new engagement. For others, it's a curse: having to re-make the same points each time; leaving behind a thing you poured your heart and soul into.

If the latter is you, then you may be happier working in a products business. Deloitte does in fact have a products business, and we would love to talk to you about it.

## Mastery of your craft (all of it)

Our clients buy Deloitte because they want quality. We are rarely the cheapest, but often the best – and indeed, the best value for money. And since everything we do is the work done by our people, "the best" applies to everyone, including you.

If you enjoy learning and strive to always be the best version of yourself that you can be, Deloitte is a good place for you. Clearly, that applies to your core technical skills, but it also applies to the other, more transferrable skills that will make you successful in the messy real world: things like communication, leadership, problem-solving, and time management. These are just as much a part of the craft, as the syntax of a programming language or proficiency with a particular toolset.

## Making an impact, big and small

We expect our people to be self-starting. If you don't like something, change it. Of course, changing it may require you to see the problem from all sides, garner support from your peers and managers, and seeing the change through.

If that kind of environment appeals to you, we are a great place to work. If you expect everything to be perfect when you step through the door, you may be disappointed. As a firm, we are constantly evolving. 

We also don't have a lot of people whose job it is solely to "run Deloitte". Most of us spend most of our time helping clients with their problems, and so we rely on everyone pitching in when it comes time to address our own. We are not perfect and we operate in an environment that never stands still, but we are very receptive of positive change.

## People who are awesome at things you never even thought about

Venture out into the world of wider Deloitte, and you'll be surprised at what you find. People with specialisms and back stories that would never have crossed your mind. The power of Deloitte is the power to combine these things. A deep expert in the oil and gas industry, working with a strategist with a genius for the unconventional, inspired by a visionary designer, grounded by an insightful user researcher, creating amazing apps with world-class analysts, engineers, and testers.

Our people are smart, but kind. We look after each other. People don't succeed at Deloitte by taking credit for the achievements of others, or burning their teams out for their own gain. Quite the opposite.

But you do have to be willing and comfortable with going out and building those relationships yourself. There isn't a map of our firm neatly furled up in every office. It is easy to feel a bit lost in it all, and branching out takes time and energy. Those who do find that time and energy, who enjoy turning over rocks to see what expertise might live beneath them, will find Deloitte a fascinating place to work.

## Learning seniority

We are at once very hierarchical and very flat. There is a rigorous set of career expectations, with feedback, reviews, and salary bands. But everyone, including the very senior, is approachable and relatable.

In fact, "seniority" – style, language, impact, influence, grasp of the detail – is one of the the things we are best at teaching our people. We have to, because even relatively early in your career, you might find yourself in a room with senior clients, needing to speak their language, to inspire them to have confidence in you, and, by extension, Deloitte.

## The value of a career

Which brings us to the career. Because more than anything, working at Deloitte is about building a career.

For most people – and there are exceptions for those with deep specialisms in particular areas for a long period of time – the value of working for us must be seen in the context of progression over a 3-5 year period. If you are looking narrowly at pay and influence *right now*, you are missing the bigger picture. If rapid progression across the full breadth of skills required to be a senior leader and/or technologist is not very interesting to you, Deloitte may not be right for you.

But if it is, your worth – both pay and  potential – increases more quickly and more deliberately at Deloitte than almost anywhere else.
