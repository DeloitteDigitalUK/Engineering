# Innovation and Learning

We work in an industry where constantly learning isn't just important -- it's vital. Nothing stands still, and what was considered good practice three years ago is now often outdated. That's why we encourage everyone to learn, experiment and innovate on the job and outside the job.

This starts with some of the mandatory (or least "strongly encouraged") learning that exists internally to help you be a good developer and a good consultant. This will be aligned to your level of seniority, and is typically targeted across the firm, which gives you a great chance to meet people outside your immediate circle.

We also have a lot of suggested learning for different technologies and career paths. This evolves all the time, and includes self-learning, books, training courses we have developed and deliver ourselves, and externally delivered content. Our aim is to say "yes" to all reasonable training requests, and to help our people figure out what they want to learn and how best to go about it.

Of course, the most important learning tends to happen on the job. We encourage and reward mentorship and have a formal coaching system for all staff to get career support. When you join a project -- especially if you are junior -- you are not expected to know everything, but you are expected to try, to ask for help in a constructive way, and to continually improve yourself.

Beyond the formal and informal learning, we want our people to experiment. We run quarterly internal hackathons that we call *mash-up days*. These are informal affairs, competed for honour not prizes. They produce both useful and, erm, *interesting*, products, such as the infamous mind-controlled Nerf gun or the heart-rate controlled Scalextric cars.

We are also huge fans of open source work. Many of our developers have made major contributions to open source projects, and we publish our own work (client confidentiality and IP rights permitting) on
[GitHub](https://github.com/DeloitteDigitalUK/).

Finally, when we have some time between projects, we try to build interesting things, both to learn new technologies and to create re-usable solutions we can leverage in a future engagement.
