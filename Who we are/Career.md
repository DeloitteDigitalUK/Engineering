# Career Paths

Like all professional services firms, Deloitte has a structured career model. Each of us operate at a given grade at any one point in time, and that grade influences things like pay, responsibilities and expectations.

The basic principle is that you are promoted when you are ready. (Promotion readiness is assessed on an annual basis, but you will be given feedback much more frequently). "Ready" in this case refers to a published set of behaviours and skills that we expect at each grade. When you demonstrate that you are already operating at the next level, you will be rewarded with promotion.

You need to take responsibility for your own career. It is important to have a direction and a sense of the "the thing you do". However, it's perfectly fine (and quite common) for that *thing* to evolve over time as you are exposed to more projects and experiences. We don't want to pigeon-hole and we actively encourage our people to broaden their experiences and learn different things, be that more programming languages, how to be an effective salesperson, or what it means to be a leader... or any number of other things. You get plenty of formal and informal support to figure all that out.

The grades in our career model are:

* **Analyst Developer**

    At this level, your main focus is on learning your craft. This is where our graduates start out, but we also hire directly into this grade. You are expected to learn quickly, to keep an open mind, to ask for help constructively, and to contribute where you can. You are part of a formal traineeship programme that aims to teach you how to be an effective consultant and a good developer. This typically lasts two years, after which you grade to become a…

* **Developer**

    Now you are no longer a trainee. You have some useful core skills in your chosen technology (or technologies), and you are starting to move beyond the precise practices you were taught, gaining a better understanding of the underlying principles that make them work. You will take responsibility for your own productivity, and begin to take ownership over components within an overall solution. It's not unlikely that you'll also start to manage and mentor some more junior people on your project.

    Developers are the engine of productivity on our projects, and typically the largest group.

* **Senior Developer**

    You are now responsible not just for the impact you make with your own work, but also for your wider impact on others, for example by leading small teams, inspiring people, taking greater responsibility for the quality and architecture of the solution, and/or building productive client relationships. You'll also start to play a bigger role in the practice and our internal community.

* **Technical Lead**

    You are now considered an expert at what you do. You might be the most senior technologist on your project, and your clients will start to see you as the face of our technical delivery. You'll be responsible for the work of several teams, either in a managerial capacity, or in a coaching and quality assurance role across multiple teams. The solution we are building has *your* name on it, so you're going to care passionately about its quality.

    You'll be inspirational to our people and our clients, and you might play a big part in our practice, for example by leading a technical community or taking ownership over things like recruitment or learning. You’ll also start to build a team around you, some of whom you will take with you as you move between projects. These people will start to see you as vital to their own career growth.

    A small number of Technical Leads might be chosen as an apprentice to a *Chief Engineer* (see below).

* **Senior Technical Lead**

    You are now a junior member of our leadership team. You'll be involved in bigger projects and responsible for more complex solutions -- solutions that your clients might consider business-critical. You are an inspiring leader and you have built a team around you, who are rooting for you to succeed.

    Some, but far from all, of our Senior Technical Leads will be recognised as a *Chief Engineer*, a particular role that describes some of our most experienced and capable technologists. Our Chief Engineers are our guardians of quality and innovation:

    * On a *project*, the role of a Chief Engineer is to **make us the best engineers we can be on that project**.

    * In the *practice*, the role of a Chief Engineer is the **make us the best engineers we can be, full stop**.

    Our Chief Engineers do this by:

    * acting as architects and technical leaders on large engagements;
    * providing technical assurance over one large and/or multiple smaller engagements;
    * offering a pragmatic, constructive counterbalance to short term date- or budget-driven decisions in the interest of doing what is right for the long term health of the solution and the delivery team;
    * inspiring our people to take pride in their craft and adopt good working practices;
    * helping project teams share their experiences and innovations with the wider practice; and
    * chairing Technical Review Boards for projects.

* **Technical Director**

    This is a senior leadership role in our business. What you do will be very personal to you and your career. You will have presented a specific business case for your promotion, which you are now executing on.

* **Partner**

    Our Partners are the owners and stewards of our business. Each project, client account and business unit will have a Partner who is ultimately personally accountable for its success. Being a Partner in Deloitte is an entrepreneurial endavour, focused on creating new opportunities and capabilities that drive us forward as a business and make this a meaningful and exciting place for our people to make their living.

People typically spend between 2 and 5 years at each stage, although there is more variation at the more senior grades. We believe that it is important that you are ready across all aspects of expectation before you are promoted. It is better to have momentum in your career than to scrape into the next grade and then fail to meet some expectations.

Similarly, there is more divergence in what people do as they become more senior. Whilst most of our junior developers will spend most of their day writing code, our senior people will find a balance of work that suits their interests and skills, branching out into things like technical leadership, building of frameworks and tools, architecture, team management, sales and the nurturing of long term client relationships, management of our own business, and more. In fact, the more senior you become, the more the focus will be on doing something new and entrepreneurial -- something that no-one else does and that is genuinely additive to our business.
