# Values

We believe that:

* we must build great experiences;
* we must leave each client better than we found it;
* we must nurture talent; and
* we must be profitable.

That is, we believe that if we do not do these things, we will not be a viable business.

A set of core values underpin our pursuit of these imperatives. These are:

1. **Ownership** – The team should own the whole delivery, and with it the focus on the end goal. We should adapt our practices in accordance with this goal. One size does not fit all, and true mastery entails knowing which rules to break and when to do so.
2. **Discovery** – Not all things are knowable *a priori*. When faced with complexity, we should not expect to get everything right on the first attempt. Instead, we want to learn fast and continually adapt.
3. **Delivery** – It is better to make progress now, realising each increment of value as early as possible and making adjustments as we go, than to defer until we think we have all the answers.
4. **Flow** – Smooth and predictable flow of work, with limited work-in-progress at any one time, is fundamental to efficiency.
5. **Collaboration** – We should foster a high-trust culture and work across functional domains in pursuit of value.
6. **Sustainability** – We should pay down team, technical, process and flow debts in a timely manner. When we take on such debt, we should do so deliberately.
7. **Elegance** – Beauty comes from within, be that for user experience, architecture, or code.

To help us live up to these values, we apply a set of heuristics
that we have collated through years of practice and experience.
