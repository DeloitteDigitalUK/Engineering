# Fixed price

Most of our projects are priced on a fixed fee for a fixed outcome. Some say that it is not possible to do Agile on this basis, but we disagree. The key is to ensure that we have flexibility over scope and capacity, a suitable and transparent contingency, and a lightweight, transparent change control process.

In many cases we will contract for a fixed high level scope, but leave the details -- and the depth of implementation -- to be defined just-in-time. The key is to focus on a clear outcome that we are accountable and responsible for delivering. We need to have sufficient control over the means of production to be both on the hook from the client's perspective, and masters of our own destiny.

In some cases clients will also come to us with a more well-defined set of requirements. That's fine too, but we usually find that we need to restructure them into a backlog of work items that fit into our process, and there are typically some gaps, some inconsistencies and some opportunities to improve. The key is to acknowledge this and engage on the basis that the scope will evolve, and that's ok.

Where at all possible, our preference is to contract first for a fixed duration "Discovery" phase, where we will deepen our understanding of the scope and context of the project, develop an "executable architecture" that proves key technical decisions with real code, set up tooling, establish governance, ramp up our team, and so on. We may go into this with a view of the total cost within a broad range (say, to within 50% confidence), but we would expect to exit with a much better estimate and so a narrower range on which to contract.
