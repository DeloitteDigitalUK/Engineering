# Staffing teams

When we staff projects, we will almost always provide teams rather than individuals. Simply put, we believe this is best for our clients and best for our people.

Our approach to quality assurance, the way in which we develop our people, and our profitability all depend on balanced teams that mix senior and junior engineers. When we end up with "ones and twos" on long term projects, they inevitably loose touch with the rest of the practice and miss out on the mentorship and experiences that allow them to grow professionally. Meanwhile, our staffing mix ends up out of kilter elsewhere, so that we are left with either senior people with no-one to lead or junior people with no-one to lead them.

Similarly, whilst a lone engineer can sometimes provide valuable skills in a pinch, our clients expect a level of quality assurance and output that can only be provided by teams working effectively together.

Finally, some of our teams are long-lived and travel together across clients and projects. This allows them to ramp up more quickly on a new engagement, and can bring vital contextual expertise to bear on new projects. For the whole to remain greater than the sum of the parts, we will strive to keep such teams together even if it means turning down short-term revenue in some cases.
