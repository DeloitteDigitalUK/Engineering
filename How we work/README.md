# How we work

How we work is a reflection of who we are and what we believe in.

We work [in teams](), shaped like a [tear-drop]().

We work [on-site with our clients](./Working%20with%20clients/On%20site), as well as through our high calibre [near-shore](./Working%20with%20clients/Near%20shore) and [off-shore](./Working%20with%20clients/Off%20shore) delivery centres.

We believe in [Agile](./Methods/Agile), [Kanban](./Methods/Kanban), and [DevOps](./Methods/DevOps).

We employ leading practices like [continuous integration], [continuous delivery], [test-driven development], [behaviour-driven development], and [robust quality assurance].

We engage with clients on a [fixed price](./Engagement%20models/Fixed%20price), [time and materials](./Engagement%20models/Time%20and%20materials), or [shared value](./Engagement%20models/Shared%20value) basis, depending on what is most appropriate.
