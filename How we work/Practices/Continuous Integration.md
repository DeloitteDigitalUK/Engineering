# Continuous integration

All our teams practice continuous integration. Each time a code change is checked in, it is built and exercised with a set of automated unit and integration tests. Build failures are found and fixed quickly.

It's all part of building quality in from the start. We use a range of tools to proactively monitor and manage internal quality, including tools for test automation, code quality analysis, performance regression testing, and more.
