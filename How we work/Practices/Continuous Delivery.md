# Continuous Delivery

The five most dangerous words in the developer vocabulary are, "It works on my machine!"  Paving a path to production is critical to gain confidence that the solutions we build will actually work when it counts.

During the early stages of a project (what we often call the Discovery phase), we will consider not just now we can develop and test, but also how we will deploy and operate the solution. Putting a small, but representative, slice of the solution through the entire journey from local development to live operation is the only way to be sure that we can arrive at an end product in a safe and predictable manner. And then we do it again. And again. So we automate and practice until golive is as routine and uneventful as possible.
