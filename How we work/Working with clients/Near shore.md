# Near-shore

We have near shore delivery teams in the UK (Belfast) and elsewhere in Europe. Through these, we are able to offer a mix of skills and scale for our projects.

We have near shore delivery teams in the UK (Belfast) and elsewhere in Europe. Through these, we are able to offer a mix of skills and scale for our projects. Our near shore teams typically work from our own studio most of the time, travelling to the client at key times during the delivery cycle. There will always be a team on site with the client too.

Making remote teams work well requires deliberate management and care. We believe it is important that everyone across the project - our staff and clients - know each other on a personal level. We will use a mixture of travel, video conferencing, real-time text chat, screen sharing, and other forms of communication to ensure that the remote team doesn't feel quite so remote at all.
