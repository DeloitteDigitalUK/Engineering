# Agile

All of our software development projects are run according to Agile principles. That is, whilst on the surface our projects will often look quite different, there is a common core that reflects our deeply held beliefs about the best way to build software solutions.

We believe in a values-based approached to Agile. We hold a core set of values and principles to be universal, and teach our people how to adapt them to the unique contexts of their engagements, recognising that no one method is going to be appropriate for all projects. Our delivery managers are skilled in a range of Agile methods and practices and will apply them with intelligence and sophistication, working with our clients do *be* Agile, rather than simply *do* one method or another.

## Principles

A series of principles illustrate how we aim to implement the values outlined
in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org).

> "**Individuals and interactions** …over processes and tools"

**1. People must have trust in one another**

... created through **honesty**, **empathy**, and effective, timely **feedback**.

**2. People must be empowered**

We must **encourage mentorship** and **work collaboratively**. Team members should be empowered to locate **accountability and decision-making closest to the work itself**.

**3. People must be part of a sustainable team**

Our teams must sustain **beyond the immediate deadline**. Their commitment should be earned and not taken for granted.

> "**Working software** …over comprehensive documentation"

**4. Our products should be simple, created iteratively, and supported by automated processes and tests**

Delivering software **driven by testing** and grounded in the conviction that **simple solutions** developed **iteratively** using **automated processes** produce well-crafted software.

**5. Practice collective ownership of the whole solution**

Provide all engineers with **first-hand experience building and maintaining all layers of the stack**,  including infrastructure.

> “**Customer collaboration** …over contract negotiation"

**6. Develop honest, collaborative partnerships with our clients.**

We must **continuously adapt** to an evolving understanding of where the **true value** for our customer lies. This is only possible from a position of **transparency**, **trust** and **alignment**.

> “**Responding to change**…over following a plan"

**7. Add value iteratively, following an evidence-based pace**

Steadily add value by delivering a **streamlined scope** in **iterative cycles** built on **data-driven** forecasting.

**8. Create feedback opportunities and learn from them**

Apply **cadences**, **make high-impact events routine**, seek **real-time feedback**, and **adapt** to each context.
