# DevOps

Far from being a hipster word for system administration, DevOps requires a new way of working, where the line between development and operations is erased. Except it's not a new way of working for us at all, it's all we've ever done.

Like Agile, DevOps is a philosophy rather than a method. Whilst there are common practices that enable DevOps-compatible ways of working (such as automated build and test, decentralised environment management, cloud infrastructure, and containers), we believe the key ingredient is shared understanding. All our engineers, regardless of technology leaning, are expected to have first-hand experience building infrastructure and the tools to manage it, and are expected to play their part in maintaining those tools.

One of those technology leanings, of course, is what we call I&E - infrastructure and environments. We typically work with our clients' technical teams to design infrastructure for our solutions that fits with their existing operational capabilities, and we have engineers who are adept at paving a path from the tools we use to enable our development teams, to the eventual operational deployment.
