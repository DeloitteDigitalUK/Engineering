# Digital platform implementation and customisation

Digital businesses run on digital platforms: platforms to engage directly with customers; to understanding and better serve them; to collect real time feedback and enable rapid learning and timely adaptation.

In Deloitte Digital Engineering we work with our strategy, proposition and creative colleagues to help clients choose, design and implement the digital platforms that underpin their business. Some of our recent projects include:

- Customer relationship management solutions that not only help keep tabs on customers and underpin an effective sales and service experience, but that put power in the hands of customers.
- Beautiful and resilient e-commerce offerings for traditional retailers as well as for product companies who sell direct-to-consumer.
- Experience management platforms that enable media companies to deliver rich customer engagement across borders and brands.
