# Maintenance and support for things we didn't build

Supportability and maintainability is front and centre when we develop solutions. We work with our colleagues in Deloitte more widely, or with third parties, to bring operations in from the start of the journey. However, our engineers in Deloitte Digital Engineering typically don't work in long term support roles unless we are helping a client continually evolve and improve a product.

Similarity, it is very rare that we will take over legacy codebases solely for the purpose of a long term support and maintenance contract.
