# Assurance and code review

In Deloitte Digital Engineering, we will often help our colleagues and clients with a coding or architecture challenge. However, we rarely do projects that involve only assurance of a process or review of a code base. This is because our focus is on technical delivery, and we understand that every piece of code is inherently coloured by the context in which it was created.

We prefer to work with our clients to understand how they can evolve what they currently have to deliver the most value, and to help them in doing so by working with them side by side.
